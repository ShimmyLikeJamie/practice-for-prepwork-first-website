      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div id="aboutMeContent">
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Jamie Wynter Oppel. I'm 27 years old as of writing, and a proud trans woman (she/her) that likes to shred guitars, program, and play video games. I have tons of passion and interests regarding self improvement and obtaining new skills.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>One thing I like to talk about when asked about growing up, is the story of when my dad gave me a computer at only age 2. It had Windows 95, though I don't remember the specs on that old thing, as it got replaced before I learned that much about computers. 
          My little baby fingers couldn't even double click a mouse fast enough for it register as a double click, so one of my first memories is my dad showing me to right click, then left click the first option in order to open the educational games from the desktop 
          that he installed for me to play.
        </p>
        <h2>Being Trans</h2>
        <p>Figuring out I'm transgender was more like a discovery that I didn't make until around 22 years old. Once I figured it out, it was like suddenly everything made sense. Turned out, I was repressing because I wasn't allowed to express myself in the ways 
          that I wanted to from a very young age. Even simple things like not being allowed to grow my hair long had long term consequences on my identity. It's okay though, my family just didn't know better and I still have a loving and accepting relationship with all of them.
